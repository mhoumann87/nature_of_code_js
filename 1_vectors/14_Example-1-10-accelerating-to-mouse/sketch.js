  In this next example, to emphasize the math, We are going to write the code using normalize() and mult(), but this is likely the last time we will do that. Youâ€™ll find setMag() in examples going forward.

  Example 1.10: Accelerating Toward the Mouse
*/

// Global variable for the mover
let mover;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 400);

  // Instantiate the mover
  mover = new Mover();
}

  function draw() {
    background(227);

    mover.move();
    mover.show();
  }
