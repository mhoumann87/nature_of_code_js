# The Nature Of Code - Javascript

My solutions and work trough the videos from [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) youtube channel.

The videos in [The Nature Of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MQ-FugwbI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM) playlist videos, and the [book](https://natureofcode.com/) will be gone through in this repository.

The javascript library [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) are used in all these examples here.

The different chapters will be up at [P5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org) and you can see the examples here.
